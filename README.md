# Hack Club Bank Operations Plugin

This Chrome extension helps speed up Hack Club Bank's operations work. It modifies various pages on Hack Club Bank and other 3rd party websites (Expensify, SVB, etc.) to simplify workflows.

Anything surrounded by a dark orange dotted line is added to the page by this plugin. Example:
